# If Something Goes Wrong

**"Application failed to respond"**
→ Go to Railway → your project → Deployments tab → check the logs
→ Usually means: variable name has a typo

**"Invalid Gemini key"**
→ Double-check you copied the full key (starts with AIza)
→ Make sure there are no spaces before/after the key in Railway

**PIN screen doesn't appear / app looks broken**
→ Hard refresh: on iPhone Safari, hold the reload button → Reload Without Content Blockers
